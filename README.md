# New Stock
Stock plugins to replace your DAW's shoddy stock effects

This is just a dumb repository to group related plugins as submodules. No actual code is here.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Volume: just a volume knob, with bit-perfect padding buttons
- [ ] Util: exactly like Volume, but with some extra panning and polarity options. Separate, as it uses more CPU
- [ ] Clip: super ergonomic and super simple clipper
- [ ] Texture: add modulated noise, for extra grittyness
